      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! As you can see above, my name is Sean, and I'm a UCSD graduate with a B.S. in Biochemistry (C/O 2019).</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Diamond Bar, California (a suburb ~40 minutes east of LA)</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Some of my hobbies include landscape photography, gaming, and golfing.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Currently, I don't really know yet. Just something that I would enjoy doing and that would benefit other people, I guess?</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>San Diego, CA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I wish to pursue some of my interests into how the internals of all the programs I use work. To build something of my own, or customize others' projects to my own preferences.</p>
